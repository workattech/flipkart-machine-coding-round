# Prepare and Practice for Flipkart Machine Coding Round

## Machine Coding Round - Introduction

Machine coding round involves solving a design problem in a matter of a couple of hours.

It requires designing and coding a clean, modular and extensible solution based on a specific set of requirements.

An example of a machine coding problem could be to design a snake and ladder game with certain requirements and constraints.

This is generally followed by a code review process where an interviewer goes through the code and tries to understand the design decisions.

There are three stages in this round:
- Pre-coding
- Coding
- Post-coding

### Pre-coding (15 minutes):
The interviewer will describe the question in detail. Feel free to ask as many questions as you need to clarify the scope and requirements with respect to the problem statement.

### Coding (90 minutes):
You will be expected to write an executable code. In between, your interviewer might have 1 or 2 checkpoints. At the end of this stage, you are expected to send your code to the interviewer. Note that this stage can be for a lesser duration in certain cases.

### Post-coding (15 minutes):
You will be expected to show a detailed demo of your program. Interviewer will key in multiple test-cases and your program is supposed to provide the expected output.

We recommend that you bring your own laptop since model options may be limited, IDE/compiler of your choice may or may not be available in the laptop provided by us.

You should focus on code hygiene (readability, modular, and testability), functional correctness and completeness, language proficiency (use the appropriate language constructs wherever applicable) and error-handling (identify the failure scenarios and necessary validations, and come up with the right
error-handling mechanism).

## Tips for the machine coding round:
- Ask as many questions as you need in order to understand the problem clearly
- Design your solution and think about the code structure before starting coding
- Ensure that the code is executable, functionally correct, modular and readable
- Machine coding round involves solving a design problem in a matter of a couple of hours.
- Ensure that the code can also accommodate new requirements with minimum changes
- Learn object-oriented programming, how to write readable code and PRACTICE
